Software Version Changes and improvements
// 23.10.1 : Initial version
// 23.10.2 : Changed the OLED library and added support for multiple OLED types and chips. 
//           Added the OLED.cfg in the SD so the user can modify the OLED display size. 
//           The chip is detected automaticaly by the library.
//           Beware : non-void functions that don't return something CRASH!!!
// 23.10.3 : Changed SaveSectorDataRecordToMDV to store sector data in the .omd file when 
//           TurboModeOn. Otherwise save does not work since it saves to .mdv sectors and 
//           reads from .omd sectors. Also the .mdv is destroyed because the sectors used
//           different!
//           The .OMD files, in order to remain optimized need to be re-optimized every 
//           time data is written in them, however since the QL does not maintain a
//           timestamp on files this needs to managed by the AK-Drive. One solution is to
//           maintain a list of modified files and re-optimize them at startup and the other
//           is to reoptimize them anyway at startup. This can be done by deleting the .mdv
//           files, renaming the .omd to mdv and then proceeding with startup.
// 23.10.4 : Changed connection of data lines to the QL. Instead of using the 74LS125 buffer
//           we are now using 2 BAT43 diodes and having the lines pulled up when at input
//           state (QL sending data) and as high power (8mA) outputs when sending data to
//           the QL (QL receiving data).
//           Also the SD card is directly connected to the pico without the extra board.
// 23.11.1 : Added support for both the old and new board. Also added a "selection efect"
//           when the user makes a selection in a menu.
//           The BOARD_VERSION define is used to compile the correct version of the firmware
//           for the target board.
//           Version 1: the fist board with the 74ls125 chip
//           Version 2: the second version with the BAT43 diodes.
// 23.11.2 : Added (c) notice.
//           Also added the Default Drive Offset selection in settings. This is usefull when
//           the number of hardware drive on the QL are more or less than 2.
//           Added the board version in txt configuration file named BoardVersion.txt. In this way
//           the same pico can be used with old an new boards by just changing the configuration 
//           in the file. The default board version is in the BOARD_VERSION define. Eventually it
//           needs to be changed to 2 when new boards get picos.
// 23.11.3 : Fixed bug the prohibited writing to AK-Drive when turbo mode was selected.
//           Changed button press timings so menu and file selection is faster.
//           Added the avility to break out of the menu if the drive is used from the QL
//           Added autoload of the first image found when the user changes the used images from the
//           QL via the runme application. Aslo fixed bug that made AK-Drive show instead of mdv8_
//           contents the previously loaded mdv.
// 23.11.4 : Added dynamic finding of MDVIMAGES file first sector. Added check for corruption of AK-Drive
//           image and message to the user.
// 23.12.1 : Fixed bug that did not delete old OMD files when an existing MDV was formated.
//           Also added a file in the formated MDV mentioning AKDrive to make happy Minerva with ToolKitII
//           since otherwise ToolkitII did not show the formated MDV.
// 24.01.1 : Changed default BoardVersion to 2
//           Added support for Hardware Microdrives control (mdv_control board). 
//           This is done through an addon board in the QL. Each hardware microdrive is connected through 
//           this addon board that is controlled from the AK-Drive.
//           The board enables the hardware drive by connecting through a bus driver the Clock, CommsIn and CommsOut
//           of the microdrive to the QL bus. 
//           If the drive is disabled CommsIN is directly connected to CommsOut and the microdrive's Clock, CommsIn and
//           CommsOut disconnected from the bus.
// 24.02.2 : Added support for small screen 128x32. Fixed bug in menu selection when going to previous page.
