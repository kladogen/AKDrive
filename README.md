Sinclair QL Microdrive Emulator
This an external microdrive emulator for the sinclair QL. It utilizes a raspberry pico to do the emulation and an SD card to hold the images. It has the ability to enable or disable the hardware microdrives with the addition to the QL of two small boards between the QL and the hardware microdrives that are controlled from the emulator. In this way you get to keep your hardware microdrives and use them whenever needed.

Also, a QL Basic application is available in mdv8_ that can be used to select directly from the QL the image to load in each drive (mdv1_ to mdv7_).

All images are optimized by the emulator to load with maximum speed.

Four buttons are available (previous, next, enter, back) to navigate the menu and an OLED screen to display the menu.
The board design is available to download and also the UDF to program the pico. In order to avoid people selling this project on ebay I will provide one license key to any one that will request it. When you use it for the first time, a file named SerNum.txt will be created in the SD card. You just send me this number and I will reply with the key that you will place in a file named lic.txt.
Enjoy!
