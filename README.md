<b>Sinclair QL Microdrive Emulator</b>

This an external microdrive emulator for the sinclair QL. It utilizes a raspberry pico to do the emulation and an SD card to hold the images. It has the ability to enable or disable the hardware microdrives with the addition to the QL of two small boards between the QL and the hardware microdrives that are controlled from the emulator. In this way you get to keep your hardware microdrives and use them whenever needed. 

<b>The emulator can read from MDV images, write to them, format them and also create new formated MDVs<\b>.

Also, a QL Basic application is available in mdv8_ that can be used to select directly from the QL the image to load in each drive (mdv1_ to mdv7_).

All images are optimized by the emulator to load with maximum speed.

Four buttons are available (previous, next, enter, back) to navigate the menu and an OLED screen to display the menu.
The board design is available to download and also the UDF to program the pico. In order to avoid people selling this project on ebay I will provide one license key to any one that will request it. When you use it for the first time, a file named SerNum.txt will be created in the SD card. You just send me this number and I will reply with the key that you will place in a file named lic.txt.

In folder PCB_43 you will find the KiCad files of the PCB rev4.3. In folder QL_MDV_Control you will find the KiCad files for the boards used to control the hardware microdrives.

Enjoy!
